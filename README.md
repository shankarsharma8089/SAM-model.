# SAM-model.

The SAM (Single-Shot Instance Segmentation) model is a state-of-the-art object detection and segmentation model that combines the strengths of two popular deep learning models: the Faster R-CNN and the Mask R-CNN. The SAM model is designed to perform both object detection and instance segmentation in a single pass, which makes it faster and more accurate than using separate models for each task.
